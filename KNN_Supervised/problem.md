Develop a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to perform binary classification on customer purchase behavior. The aim is to preprocess the dataset, implement the KNN algorithm using Euclidean distance for various
values, and evaluate the classifier's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix metrics, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the optimal.
