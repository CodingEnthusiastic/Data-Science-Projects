In this notebook, we will explore underfitting and overfitting by using a synthetic dataset and comparing two models:

A simple Linear Regression, which may suffer from underfitting.
A Polynomial Regression with a high degree, which may suffer from overfitting.
We will also visualize the effects of both underfitting and overfitting.
